        <h1>Clinical psychology services for adolescents</h1>
        <p>Adolescence is a turbulent period that involves negotiating the opposing forces of dependence and individuation. During this time troubles often arise such as feelings of anxiety, sadness, self-consciousness, insecurity, irritability, problems in friendships, risky behaviour such as unwanted or unsafe sex, self harm, thoughts of suicide and substance use, aggression, avoidance of school and school work and rule breaking behaviour.</p>
        <p>Parents often notice that their son or daughter seems so troubled, and yet rather than reaching for the support of their family, some will isolate themselves and withdraw, or become irritable and unreachable. This can be baffling and frustrating for families.</p>
        <p>A particular area of practice that I enjoy is working with adolescents from the age of 14 and up. I have over eight years’ experience working at the Drug and Alcohol Youth Service and in my private practice, helping adolescents and families come together, build connections and work through this stage successfully.</p>

        <h2>Who should come to therapy?</h2>
        <p>If a young person is open to seeking help, I will usually meet with the young person first.  I will include parents in the process to the extent that the young person consents. Adolescents may want to keep things confidential from their parents, and this is often developmentally appropriate. In any case I will always encourage them to include their parents as much as possible. For example, most young people are agreeable to me obtaining a developmental history from their parents and then outlining our assessment and treatment plans.  Importantly, although they may wish to keep some things confidential we will negotiate safety and duty of care so that the limits of confidentiality are clear and agreed upon by the parents, the young person and me. </p>
        <p>If a young person does not want to come in to therapy, I will meet with the parents to explore their sense of how to best go about supporting the young person. Often this opens up their conversations with the young person and in time may lead to the young person commencing their own therapy.</p>
        <p>I believe it is important to hold this goal of family inclusion being at the pace of the young person, so that as much as they feel comfortable, valuable family supports can be accessed, but also so that the young person does not have the sense that they are ‘the problem’, but rather that there is a problem for the family to navigate together.</p>
